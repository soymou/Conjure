# AGENTS.md
- **First run:** If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it.
- **Every session:** Read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and today’s/yesterday’s `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. In a main session also read `MEMORY.md` before any work.
- **Memory notes:** Use `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily logs and `MEMORY.md` for curated long-term lessons (main session only).
- **Safety:** Never share private data or run destructive commands without asking.
